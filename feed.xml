You are in the right place. There’s a huge list of features that Postgres is offering, and Window functions are a part of this overall offering, basically they are a part of these vast analytical toolsets that Postgres offer.</p> <p><strong>What are these window functions actually?</strong></p> <p>A <a href="https://www.gooddata.com/blog/sql-21st-century-analytic-window-functions/">window function</a>/ an analytical function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that aresomehow related to the current row. That’s kind of obvious and similar to what aggregate functions do, right? Yes and No. There’s a fundamental difference between window functions and other functions, i.e., window functions do not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row like non-window aggregate functions would.</p> <p><strong>Interesting, but how are they useful?</strong></p> <p>Let us look at a small case study to better understand the window functions and their magic! In this article we use a table called ‘topups’ from a database of a small mobile company. We have a flat file in a TSV format. Let us go ahead and import this data.</p> <h2 id="1-loading-the-data">1. Loading the Data</h2> <p>Instead of copying and morphing the data, we keep the integrity of the source data by accessing the data using a foreign table, which is one of the many ways to access remote data. To do this we make use of an extension called file_fdw, which is a module that provides foreign data wrapper tool.</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Once the extension is installed we can easily create a table by accessing the data from the remote server we just created. However, we need to make sure the column are defined exactly as in the source database. The syntax looks something as below.</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Now, we can either copy this to a new table or directly access data from this foreign table.</p> <h2 id="2-aggregations">2. Aggregations</h2> <p>The data we are about to access looks something like this,</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>There are different types of window functions, and can be grouped into the following,</p> <ul> <li>Aggregate Window Functions SUM (), MAX (), MIN (), AVG (), COUNT ()</li> <li>Ranking Window Functions RANK (), DENSE_RANK (), ROW_NUMBER (), NTILE ()</li> <li>Value Window Functions LAG (), LEAD (), FIRST_VALUE (), LAST_VALUE ()</li> </ul> <p>We take a look at some of the window functions and their examples using our foreign table, ‘topups’</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Listing the total of ALL topups done by a user, if they have ever had a top up of exactly € 15 </code> The first thought in our mind would be to use a select query to get all the users (id_user) who have had a top up of € 15 and any top ups other than €15. This requires a nested select query and a join operation. But can also be done using a single select statement, however, this only works if and only if we know that all the users have at least once done a €15 top up.</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>The previous code results in an output as below</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>In the above example we have assumed that all users have made a top up of €15 at least once, but what if we did not have this information?</p> <p>So, what do we do now? We go for aggregate functions! (Traditionally)</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Output will be like below</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>We can clearly see that simple aggregate function can solve this problem. But why do we need the window function? Just look at the code above, its long, confusing for other people and its messy. Hence, we will try to solve the same problem by using the window function and see for ourselves, the magic of window functions!</p> <p><strong>Take a look at this snippet of code below</strong></p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>WOW! What happened here. The query length is reduced to less than half and this also keeps the identity of each row, allowing us an access to the gateway for plenty of analysis which previously was hindered due to the usage of mere aggregate functions.</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>For example, the date column has still maintained its integrity when we use a window function, which is a huge advantage while doing several data analytics tasks which we will see further in this article.</p> <p>SQL window functions, as demonstrated in this article, are a powerful notion that enables for sophisticated computations. A typical window function consists of an expression and a window specification, with optional partitioning and a frame clause, and the possibilities for slicing, smoothing, interconnecting, and deduplicate data are virtually limitless. There are plenty of interesting use cases where these functions give a great value. We’ll continue talking about them in the next few sections. Stay tuned!</p> <h2 id="3-row-sequencing-part-1">3. Row-sequencing part 1</h2> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Displaying latest top 5 top ups for each user</code></p> <p>The first thought now would be… definitely a lot of subqueries and join operations. Very tedious! But also, using the general aggregate functions would combine the rows and output a single row. If we recall the introduction section of this article, we can say this is where the magic of window functions happens. We make use of Ranking window functions to solve this problem and still display individual rows for each operation.</p> <p><strong>Consider the code snippet below</strong></p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>The output will be something like this</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Same date but ranked in decreasing order of top up value</p> <p>We successfully completed the task 3 by using a combination of a few window functions, which are easy to read, understand and debug!</p> <h2 id="4-row-sequencing-part-2">4. Row sequencing part 2</h2> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Displaying Top 5 largest topups by each user, while retaining the immediately following topups if the subsequent values are same</code></p> <p><strong>Consider the code snippet below</strong></p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf10.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>The output will be as follows</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf11.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Just by altering a few lines, we now have solved task too. That is the power of window functions!</p> <h2 id="5-inter-row-calculations">5. Inter-row calculations</h2> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Creating a new table using the original table by adding additional columns</code></p> <p>We can easily create a new table from an existing dataset whilst creating new columns using the operations performed on the older tables’ columns. Window functions, as opposed to aggregation, return a result for each row. You can use window functions in a Custom Formula transformation of a Data Prep recipe.</p> <p><strong>Consider the code snippet below</strong></p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf12.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>The new table created looks like below</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf13.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="6-bonus">6. Bonus!</h2> <p>Now to the final task! We use all the knowledge gained till now and use it all to solve a single problem. Let us consider a Promotion scheme run by our mobile company. The gift is a free credit for 28 days if a user tops up by €20 or more. Promotion will be applied the same day of the top up immediately. So, we need to find the users who are eligible for the promotion and their promotion period. Promotion can be availed multiple time too!</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf14.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>So, what will be our approach to solve this? A good approach will be to filter out topups which are €20 or more for each user and compute the difference between their subsequent latest topups. Then setting flags for start and end period will further help us to filter only those which fall in the 28 - day period (for every start period +28 is added to get end period). Then we can sort individual users who are eligible, and we have our desired output!</p> <p>The output will be as follows</p> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wf15.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <div> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/posts/wfm.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Basically, window functions are very powerful!</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Source: https://www.toptal.com/sql/intro-to-sql-windows-functions

We discovered that window functions execute calculations in the same way as aggregation functions do, but with the extra bonus of having access to data within individual rows, making them extremely powerful. Also, the window functions only need one sequential scan of the table and regular joins need 2 sequential scans of the table values.</p> <p>They always contain the OVER clause, and may contain PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, and a host of aggregating (SUM, COUNT, etc.) and other positional functions (LEAD, LAG).

A birth condition did not allow him to play sports and indulge in other activities;hence he became an avid reader. Winner noticed a relationship between his learnings and technology going out of control through his childhood movie viewing, love of sci-fi and books. (Garvey 2017) In his opinion, technology is intrinsically political, in that each specific technology allows a community to make some political choices on how to use it and adapt to it. In his 1977 book “Autonomous Technologies”, Winner attacks the idea of technologies being value-neutral (and people and their perspectives make them good or bad) (Winner 1977). So, What does his 1980 article “Do Artifacts Have Politics” tell its readers? An academic way to look at it, and in the words of Prof. Langdon winner itself, is to understand the article’s basis by looking at the definitions of the two crucial themes embedded throughout the article. 1) Politics – is a distribution of power, authority, and privilege. 2) Technology - The way of building order in the world. The way that takes out the chaos and brings order in the world. (Gorichanaz 2020)By extracting an overview of discrimination highlighted in the article, we can say the stratification can be in 2 main ways: decision and necessity (Winner 1980). For example; By decision, the shape of anyclassroom is a type of political arrangement, and several such examples can be found everywhere. However, the prominent example we all remember is building bridges by then master builder Robert Moses in long island, New York. i.e., how a designer of roads, parks and bridges, built his creations that were purely out of class and racial bias. His bridge-cage shows us that he did not want poorpeople/more people/black people in his fancy beach meant for the high class. An example of strata by necessity is Nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy is not something anyone can try to produce at will. It requires centralized authority, infrastructure etc. However, solar power is distributed, and anyone can have it (Gorichanaz 2020). The available evidence tends to show that many large, sophisticated tech systems are, in fact, highly compatible with centralized, hierarchical managerial control.Overall, Towards technology and its artifacts, Prof. Langdon Winner’s parting questions to the readers are;</p> <ol> <li>Should we adopt it?</li> <li>If yes, In what form?</li> </ol> <h1 id="review">Review</h1> <p>Cultural or Technological artifacts are not inherently political; however, they indeed tend to have politics through associations. Technologies around the time when Prof. Langdon Winner wrote the article was limited and much more mundane. The idea of mobile computing was just a thought experiment. Now, we are in a time where we are about to unleash artificial intelligence. So, we need to ask ourselves, what is our responsibility to restore the balance that this technology has disrupted? (Barba 2018)</p> <h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1> <p>Based on the technological innovations in his time, Winner’s article features the social stratification by only a few main types, which we already discussed in the above sections, i.e., by decision and necessity. However, we can see various other types in which technology is reshaping society. For example; We can talk about a new unintentional type of stratification which is neither necessary nor decided by any centralized body. It is purely collateral damage in the creation and usage of new technology. One such example is the “Algorithmic bias” (TRT world 2018). As artificial intelligence progresses exponentially, the errors it makes can also be exponential. The data-based architecture embedded in the AI algorithms can be unintentionally sexist, racist etc.Moreover, the people who control the data to train these models can impose a significant bias through the system. As more and more industries that profoundly impact humans turn towards using these algorithmic approaches, this algorithmic bias plays a significant factor in shaping society. To conclude,we can say the group of people who get it very well would be the technologists. A group of people who do not understand it or have minimal understanding would be the policymakers.

The related variables simulated were GDP per capita, capital intensity, and labour productivity using the well known Cobb-Douglas Production function; After being transformed into valid econometric models, the established theoretical models were empirically checked; This study found out that increase in technology resulted in an economic growth. Furthermore, the effects of capital input and labour input are also briefly examined.</p> <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Economic growth; Technology; Productivity; advanced countries</p> <h1 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h1> <p>The thesis is useful on a quantitative basis because it sought to model the real level of technology by separating other factors from the “remaining value”. (Bekar et al. 2018). Totalfactor productivity is the term most widely used by economists (TFP), which is also generally known as “remaining value” or “residual value”(Kenton 2000). The difference betweenthe proportional change in output and the proportional change in a Divisa index of inputs is known as total factor productivity. Solow’s “remaining value,” according to Liu Sifeng (Yuan et al. 2009), reflects the contribution of all variables in the Cobb-Douglas production function except fund and labour to output ratio. Hence, the study looks at technology factor separately from the “remaining value” and estimates its effects on economic growth. Furthermore, the report contends on a brief examination, that increases in either labour or capital productivity led to a fall in economic development(Alani 2012). According to the report, this is attributed to an increase in leisure use after an increase in either capital or labour productivity, since people prefer to trade off leisure for jobs as their incomes grow.</p> <h1 id="2-research-objectives">2. Research Objectives</h1> <ul> <li>Analysis of the impact of the level of technology on economic development in advanced countries during the aforementioned period.</li> <li>To test the separation of the amount of technological advancement from the “remaining value” or TFP.</li> <li>Checking whether the technology progress has the same effect across the 2 groups of aforementioned countries.</li> <li>Brief examination of capital and labour inputs.</li> </ul> <h1 id="3-literature-review">3. Literature Review</h1> <p>The literature review focuses on estimating the impact of technological advancement on economic development. Following the study, a new paradigm connecting technical innovation and labour and capital productivity is created. conomists like (Carlaw and Lipsey 2003) suggest that the total factor productivity is often interpreted as the technological progress and which in turn promotes economic growth. However, there seems to be a major error in measuring the technology factor from the TFP as a whole. (Hulten 2001) identified that the various factors contributing to the TFP are not measured individually but grouped together as a residual or “remaining value”. In particular, there is an increasing body of literature demonstrating that productivity growth is not an indicator of technical progress (Gordon 2000). As a result, TFP is a deceptive definition of productivity because: (a) a critical analysis of the Cobb-Douglas production function reveals that typical TFP exceeds real TFP by an amount equal to the growth in output. (b) the majority of economists who write about total factor productivity, It’s possible that they didn’t bother differentiating it from the level of technology or the technology factor (Alani 2012). Furthermore, most economists, like (Casetti and Jones 1983) and (Hornstein and Krusell 1996), believe that increased productivity leads to ncreased economic growth. Theoretical models derived from the Cobb-Douglas output function, such as the one described in this study, seem to extend support to this belief.</p> <h2 id="31-model-background">3.1. Model Background</h2> <p>The Cobb-Douglas production function, as advanced by Knut Wicksell (Edward Elgar 2021) and statistically evaluated to provide proof by Paul Douglas and Charles Cobb in 1928 (Cobb and Douglas 1928), is the most commonly used in economics to describe the relationship between output and inputs.</p> \[𝑌 = 𝐴𝐾^𝛼𝐿^𝛽\] <p>𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑌 = 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡, 𝐴 = 𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑛𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 ,𝐾 = 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡, 𝐿 = 𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡</p> <p>In the above equation the α and β are constants that are determined by technology. Whereas, in macroeconomic modelling, the Cobb-Douglas output function is given by,</p> \[𝑄 = 𝐾^𝛼𝐿^ {1−𝛼}\] <p>𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑄 = 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡,𝐾 = 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 , 𝐿 = 𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑟 73</p> <p>This equation is first order homogenous as the returns to scale is constant (Cobb and Douglas 1928). A constant returns to scale tells us that the output will increase proportional to the increase in all the input variables by the ame factor (Peston 1960). However, in this study we modify the above equation to model the technology factor and estimate its effects. Now, the equation becomes</p> \[𝑌 = 𝐴^𝜆𝐾^𝛼𝐿^𝛽\] <p>Here, the returns -to-scale is given by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">𝛾 = 𝜆 + 𝛼 + 𝛽</code></p> <p>We shall use this returns to scale metric in further sections to validate our hypothesis in this study. We see, if we are getting a constant returns to scale, and increase in returns to scale or a decrease in returns to scale. In hindsight, we are looking at a macro economics of scale for advanced nations (Investopedia 2014).</p> <h2 id="32-model-of-technological-progress">3.2. Model of technological progress</h2> <p>Tinbergen’s improved Cobb-Douglas output function (TINBERGEN 1964) is often used to measure the contribution of technical innovation to economic development. Solow’s “remaining benefit,” according to Liu Sifeng, reflects the ontribution of all variables but capital and labour to the production ratio (Yuan et al. 2009). However, Liu Sifeng claims that the approach has some significant flaws that make it impossible to make accurate predictions in a realistic analysis. This is because a variety of random factors influence production growth, contributing to an overestimation of technological growth factor. (Liu et al. 2009) went on to distinguish the influences of other causes from the “remaining value” in order to achieve a more accurate estimate of technological progress. However, their method does not consider the direct effect of technological progress. It only estimates the time variation of technological progress (Alani 2012). Hence, the modified equation mentioned above will be a good consideration for our study.</p> <h2 id="33-initial-assumptions">3.3. Initial assumptions</h2> <p>The current thesis advances the idea that technological growth varies exponentially with respect to productivity. Solow’s “remaining value” is used to calculate the pace of technological change that is given by,</p> \[\frac{ΔA}{A}=\frac{ΔY}{Y}− 𝛼\frac{ΔK}{K} − 𝛽\frac{ΔL}{L}\] <p>A least squares estimation might be used to remove the effect of non-technological parameters’ progress and other factors such as random inflation. It is very evident that it is difficult to obtain the other factors through the “remaining value” function (Alani 2012). However, we evaluate the calculated ‘A’ with the TFP values for the respective countries and examine the relation between them. This tells us if the TFP or the “remaining value” is actually the technological parameter. In the demand side, manufacturers would tend to lower their labour demand and they would like to create the same amount of production with less labour because labour productivity has improved in order to gain more income (Lindenberger 2003). Workers enjoy more leisure when their wages hit the ideal amount for a comfortable standard of living, while higher wage prices provide a disincentive for working longer hours (Koutsoyiannis 1979). As a result, employers would consider it fair to work fewer hours to achieve the same amount of production if their productivity had improved (Alani 2012). Also, production decreases as efficiency increases, resulting in an inverse relationship between productivity and output.</p> <p>\(\frac{ΔY}{ΔK}= (\frac{−𝛼}{1 − 𝛼 − 𝛽})(\frac{𝑌^{1+ 𝛼 + 𝛽}}{𝐾})\) Capital Productivity</p> <p>\(\frac{ΔY}{ΔL}= (\frac{−𝛼}{1 − 𝛼 − 𝛽})(\frac{𝑌^{1+ 𝛼 + 𝛽}}{L})\) Labour Productivity</p> <p>We have theoretical assumptions and empirical studies suggesting a decrease in returns to scale based on labour and capital productivity i.e., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0 &lt; 𝛼 +𝛽 &lt; 1</code></p> <p>Theories of Capital and labour productivity derive an output function with respect to increase in respective productivities. Substituting the labour and capital productivity in place of capital and labour growth in Cobb-Douglass function will enable us to evaluate the effects on economic growth (Alani 2012).After relevant substitutions, data was gathered directly for capital and labour productivities, the per capita gross domestic products, and the total factor productivity for Euro region and the G7 nations (Bergeaud et al. 2019).</p> <h2 id="34-the-data">3.4 The data</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Pages</th> <th style="text-align: center">Series Name</th> <th style="text-align: right">Units</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">LP</td> <td style="text-align: center">Labour productivity</td> <td style="text-align: right">$US 2010 ppp per hours</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">TFP</td> <td style="text-align: center">Total Factor Productivity</td> <td style="text-align: right">$US 2010 ppp based</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">KI</td> <td style="text-align: center">Capital Intensity</td> <td style="text-align: right">$US 2010 ppp per hours</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">GDP pc</td> <td style="text-align: center">Gross Domestic Product per capita</td> <td style="text-align: right">$US 2010 ppp per persons</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Our key dataset is the one used by (Bergeaud et al. 2019), and it is based on the work of (Cette et al. 016) and (Bergeaud et al. 2018), which collected data for 17 OECD countries from 1890 to 2019. These countries were selected based on their economic importance: the G7 (the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Canada), five other eurozone countries (Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Finland), and five other countries that account for a large share of global GDP at any point during our time span or have a particular interest in terms of productivity (Australia, Switzer- land, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway). In comparison, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Finland have reformed the Eurozone. This approximation seems to be acceptable given that these eight countries accounted for 93.2 percent of Eurozone GDP in 2010. The year 1890 was selected as the starting point in order to provide a sufficiently long time series to initialize our capital stock (Alani 2012). However, for our study we chose, 2 group of countries: The G7 nations and the nations grouped as Euro area. The reason was to develop a comparison of technological growth and investment with respect to economic growth over 130 years (De la Escosura 2015). We used series constructed by economists and historians on clear assumptions for long aggregate historical results. Many of these data are subject to confusion and inaccuracy, not just for distant but also for recent times. The data was compiled at the country level under the assumption of constant boundaries, in their most recent condition (Alani 2012). One critical factor in answering these questions is quantifying the impact of conventional growth factors (capital, labour) when accounting for their efficiency, but beyond this growth accounting exercise, delving deeper into the role of General-Purpose Technologies (GPT) in long-term growth. Development accounting (Kenton 2000) was the first effort to explore the relative functions of output factors, but it failed to explain the majority of twentieth-century growth, which was due to total factor productivity (TFP), the residual of this decomposition. This notion of TFP being related to technology is largely because it is hard to capture the effects of other residual factors affecting economic growth. In our next section let us look at the framework used in this study, and the process and methodology used to develop it. However, we have already established a firm base in section 3.3 assuming the replacements of capital growth and labour growth by capital intensity and labour productivity as a basis of our model. At this point, the a priori assumptions shall be an increase in returns to scale with respect to technological progress, and a decrease in returns to scale with respect to labour and capital productivity.</p> <h1 id="4-methodology-and-framework">4. Methodology and framework</h1> <p>After evaluating a number of econometric models, Jimmy Alani hypothesized the actual level of echnological progress that could have increased economic growth (Alani 2012). However, the capital labour productivity growth seemed to reduce the economic growth. An initial regression of Y running on capital input K and Labour input L gives us α and β values. Using these values, we can calculate the value of technology parameter.</p> <p>Further we model the level of technology or the technology factor using the formula</p> \[𝐴 =\frac{𝑌}{𝐾^𝛼𝐿^𝛽}\] <p>Relevant regressions were performed, and real level of technology’s value was calculated, assuming the coefficient of the level of technology (λ) is equal to 1. Our alternative hypothesis was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">λ≠1</code>.</p> <p>By using the above capital productivity and labour productivity equations and econometric model hypothesized by (Alani 2012) that real technological development could have enhanced economic growth, while capital and labour productivity growth could have decreased economic growth. This equation is given by</p> <p>Two groups of countries were selected to perform a comparative study. Both being highly advanced group of nations, where some countries are a part of both the groups. However, we evaluate these nations as a group economy for the basis of this study.</p> \[\frac{ΔY}{(𝑌−1)} = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1\frac{(ΔAa)}{(Aa−1)} − 𝛽2\frac{(ΔK)}{(𝐾−1)} − 𝛽3\frac{(ΔL)}{(𝐿−1)} + 𝜀\] <p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">𝛽0 = 0, 𝛽1 = 1, 0 &lt; 𝛽2 &lt; 1, 0 &lt; 𝛽3 &lt; 1</code></p> <p>However, we will not be running regressions on this equation, as this is relative change in variables, we only shall look at the previous equation for the purpose of this current study. Estimation strategy for TFP used by (Bergeaud et al. 2019) is keeping the alpha at a constant 0.3. With alpha = 0.3, the global share of wealth, is believed to be invariant and constant over all countries. We shall notice further that this value is not equal to the estimated value of coefficients. Hence, to calculate the technological parameter we shall first run a regression on Y (The economic growth) using both capital intensity (K) and Labour productivity (L). The resulting α and β values shall be used to generate ‘A’ the technological parameter. Since our series begins in 1890, we do not cover the entire first industrial revolution, which was already waning in many countries by the end of the nineteenth century. As a result, we begin our series in 1905, including in our estimations. For a longer series, we may have selected other general-purpose inventions to concentrate on in the second half of the 19th century, such as the steam engine or railways (Bergeaud et al. 2018). We answer these questions by examining productivity growth drivers in the twentieth century. To begin, productivity, and more specifically TFP, has been the primary contributor to 20th-century development. Since TFP is calculated as a residual of a growth decomposition equation (Greasley and Madsen 2017), there is often the possibility that output factors were determined incorrectly, which leads to ascribe too much weight to TFP in growth dynamics.</p> <h1 id="5-discussion">5.

This is also a strong suggestions of many economists (TINBERGEN 1964). However, this model is too perfect with a R-squared of 1.

We discovered that a 1% rise in technical development could more than double production if it were followed by improvements in capital and labour productivity.

Furthermore, this inclusion model says that, increase in technology increases economic growth in equal proportion, but increase in labour and capital productivity decreases the economic growth, and a huge collinearity is seen between labour and capital. The same inference is to be found with the G7 countries as well. Nevertheless, it is evident (see Figure 1) that increase in technology will exponentially increase the economic growth and capital and labour productivity does not contribute to this growth in a positive way. So, before we study better models, lets us look at our previous models for both Euro and G7 nations, in depth. To do this, we look at residual analysis of aforementioned models for both Euro and GDP nations. Residuals are the variations between the model’s one-step expected performance and the observed output from the validation data collection. As a result, residuals reflect the part of the validation data that the model does not describe (MathWorks Australia 2016).</p> <h2 id="53-analysis-of-all-the-previous-models">5.3 Analysis of all the previous models</h2> <p>Let us first take a look at the residuals of our models.

As a result, the assumption here is that heteroscedasticity does not happen since the chaos seems to be regulated as years pass by. The distribution of uniform residuals, however, varies as the leverage, or exposure of the fitted output to a change in input is varied. In our base models, a clustered influence of all the residuals can be seen without many outliers. This can be based that, Total factor productivity did not consider technology alone, but a number of other factors lumped together as “remaining value”. However, in our tech models, we can see equal distribution of residual influence throughout the years, which tells us that our technological factor is the major reason for economic growth in these advanced nations.</p> <h1 id="6-results-and-further-research">6. Results and further research</h1> <ul> <li> <p>The technological impact on the economic growth is very evident and it could have caused an exponential growth in the GDP.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Technological factor influence and the TFP or the “remaining value” influence seem to be very similar. This suggests that a major part of the TFP is the technological boom during certain points in history, for example, the world war and industrial revolution. Figure 3 helps us to notice this differentiation very well, while examining the residual influence plots for TFP and technological factor equations.</p> </li> <li> <p>The above results were seen common among both the groups of advanced nations; however, an interesting conclusion was arrived in the time of technology adaptation. The G7 nations seem to have invested in the advanced technologies a few years earlier than the euro group nations, as evident from Figures 1 and 2.</p> </li> <li> <p>A theoretical research and empirical study of the capital and labour factors implicate that as capital and labour productivity increases, the economy decreases. According to research (Alani 2012)a, this is found to be due to the adaptation of leisure with a stable economy among the workforce. A further research could be the analysis of the equation of focus as discussed in section 4.</p> </li> </ul> \[\frac{ΔY}{𝑌−1}= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1\frac{ΔAa}{Aa−1} − 𝛽2\frac{ΔK}{𝐾−1}− 𝛽3\frac{ΔL}{𝐿−1}\] <p>This will allow us to look at more contributing factors and also the modification of currently involved factors. For example, ‘the age of capital’ is very good measure to examine the effects on GDP. As per (Kisch and Henderson 1982) age of capital is just the vintage effect on the capital, that is older capital is less productive than the new capital. Furthermore, the diffusion of technology can be considered as an interesting observation was found in this study, the availability of technology in different areas can be considered for a better estimation.</p> <h1 id="7-conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1> <p>Econometric research made on advanced nations over a 130-year period from 1890 to 2019 came up with following findings; 1) Growth in Technological progress results in increased economy and growth in capital and labour productivity decreases the economic growth. 2) However, most of the findings were same across the two sample sets of nations, G7 and Euro, the G7 nations seemed to have adapted the technology earlier than Euro group of nations. 3) Value of Technology is a major factor in TFP, but its subject to technology diffusion. Most of the a priori assumptions were proved right, and an interesting observation was recorded with G7 nations. Autocorrelation was detected which implied a vague repetition of the relative past events (in terms of technology adaptation). The study concluded by a positive closure and further developments in modified and/or new variables.</p> <h1 id="8-references">8. References</h1> <p>Alani, J.

She is<br/> <strong>DIANA FRANCES SPENCER</strong></p> <p>Leaders are critical because they instil trust in their followers and assist them in achieving shared goals. There are several leadership models, and in this article, we will examine two great leaders with a blend of multiple leadership styles. Both being transformational and charismatic, yet extremely kind and servant leaders.</p> <h1 id="the-underlying-philosophy">The Underlying Philosophy</h1> <h2 id="defining-leadership">Defining Leadership</h2> <p>Leadership is not a position; it is an action. It is the ability to ‘consistently’ embrace the consequences of decisions made and make the next decision better. Leaders emerge based on the circumstances. Hence, not all leaders are suitable for all cases.</p> <ul> <li>Who is a Leader? We always look up to leaders. However, in attempting to explain how leadership works, we often lose sight of the idea that supporters are an essential part of the equation. Unfortunately, they are given short shrift in management literature. Instead, they are portrayed as merely reacting to their leaders’ charisma or loving attitudes (Lafair 2004). This concept is also applicable to humans in general as a species looking up to a leader. Ira Chaleff created a typology to emphasise the importance of followers in the leadership process (Chaleff 1997). He developed his typology as a result of a seminal moment in his formative years when he became mindful of the atrocities of the Holocaust, which killed over 6 million European Jews during World War II. Chaleff felt a moral obligation to investigate why people supported German leader Adolf Hitler, a purveyor of hatred and death (Chaleff 2008). Rather than representing kings, Chaleff contends that followers, as leaders, have a shared cause and that both leaders and followers strive to accomplish mutual goals. According to Chaleff, followers must take a more constructive position equal to the leader’s role (Chaleff 2009). So, when a purpose greater than oneself is found, a great leader will emerge with the greatest of followers.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>image will be added</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="philosophy-of-leadership-and-influence">Philosophy of Leadership and Influence</h2> <p>“A Leader is someone who thinks lightly of themself and deeply of the world while trying to solve larger than life questions fueling their hope-filled, interminable drive to reach for the stars eventually.”</p> <p>As an assertive architect (INTJ-A), one of the rarest and capable personality types, the innate instincts of INTJs revolve around the constant analysis of things around them. However, they never lose hope that, with enough imagination and insight, they will find a way to succeed, regardless of the obstacles that might emerge along the way (Personalities 2020).My philosophy of leadership is an accumulation of various events and people throughout my lifetime. As an INTJ, a leadership ability of 10-12% is inherited (Paul 2016). Furthermore, a personal drive and attitude towards becoming a leader in the initial childhood years could be accounted for a total of 30% leadership ability to start. Age 10 to 15 was a crucial period in shaping an overall leadership agenda, where extensive reading, heroic media influence instilled a drive to see oneself in those positions. A father’s journey from rags to riches, hiding the hardships behind a smile, sacrifices made to keep the family happy, and ability to learn and adapt without proper education acted as the most useful extrinsic motivation tools. Building a start-up at the age of 18 is the most prominent additive factor for the overall increase in leadership ability, where a student had to lead a group of more students to create an idea into an award-winning start-up company. Furthermore, moving ~7000 kilometres away from the home country to pursue knowledge and adventure will increase leadership ability near the natural threshold. Once the overall leadership is nearing the verge of an individual’s threshold, a further increase will only be based on the execution of consistent leadership tasks (Bilotta 2017)</p> <h2 id="can-anybody-be-a-leader">Can anybody be a leader?</h2> <p>Based on the previous sections, it is evident that leadership can be both innate and developed. However, the ‘ability to develop leadership’ may or may not be natural. In addition to definitional concerns, it is essential to address several other issues concerning the essence of leadership. We will discuss how leadership as a characteristic (innate) differs from leadership as a mechanism (developed), how appointed leadership differs from emergent leadership, and how the principles of authority and coercion differ from leadership in the following section (Kirchner 1990).</p> <p><strong>Innate Leadership:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>image will be added</p> </blockquote> <p>The characteristic perspective views leadership as a property or collection of properties that various individuals hold to differing degrees. This view implies that the ability remains in a chosen few and limits oversight to those who are thought to have rare, normally inborn, gifts (Jago 2015). Hence, this type of leadership is valid for only a particular kind of leaders.</p> <p><strong>Developed Leadership:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>image will be added</p> </blockquote> <p>According to the mechanism perspective, leadership is a concept that exists within the framework of relationships between leaders and followers and makes leadership accessible to all. Leadership can be experienced and learned as a mechanism through leader habits (Jago 1982). The process definition of leadership is consistent with the philosophy of leadership that we have seen before in the previous sections.</p> <ul> <li>Reality vs Philosophy The philosophy portrayed throughout the earlier sections is what I aim to achieve as a leader. Nevertheless, my pathway and ideology lead me towards a leader well fit in times of a crisis. Hence, a leader who thinks more of the world than oneself is the right path to someone like myself with a perfect blend of abilities and experiences.</li> </ul> <h1 id="leadership-challenge--elon-musk">Leadership Challenge – Elon Musk</h1> <h2 id="about-the-leader">About the leader</h2> <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born in South Africa and raised there. Musk aspired to become a resident of the United States as a child. Elon Musk immigrated to Canada as a young adult, where he became a citizen through his mother’s ancestry. Musk, a Canadian citizen, earned a living by manual labour in a variety of occupations and positions. Musk’s professional history demonstrates his drive to excel. Musk’s professional history demonstrates his drive to excel. Most sources begin with his enrollment at Queens College in Canada. According to some reporters (Anderson 2016), “before finishing his degree, [Musk] came to the United States as a foreign student.” Once Elon Musk’s childhood dream of visiting the United States was realised, he “made his way out to Silicon Valley, obtained legal permission to work” via a visa, and launched his first business company, Zip2, with the help of his partner (Gilbert Bonner 2017). Elon Musk rose from this entrepreneurial launching pad to become the founder and CEO of Tesla Motors, SolarCity, and SpaceX. The latter has emerged as the most prominent Musk-related topic in today’s newspapers (Marques 2017). Elon Musk is the epitome of a competent leader. He is one of the most influential businessmen of our day. Elon Musk has not only flourished in the entrepreneurship realm with his many successful start-ups, but he has also been able to lead these businesses through their journeys of massive success and into the national spotlight (Yauney 2018).</p> <h2 id="challenge-facing-the-leader---trust">Challenge facing the leader - Trust</h2> <p>Elon Musk, one of the world’s most influential leaders, with a net worth of $173.6 billion and ownership of many businesses struggled several times during his career, but it was those failures that propelled him to prominence today. Using his mistakes as an example of a daunting path to a fruitful conclusion, we will examine his most recent and biggest challenge (Ibrahim 2016). Elon Musk exemplifies the most pressing issue that CEOs are now confronted by. It’s palpable how much of a difference a few months will make on how people perceive leadership (Matyszczyk 2020). The challenge is “Trust”. What used to be people’s most trusted institutions? the beacons of hope? Realisation of dreams? The answer is ‘Businesses’. Business Leaders have been fascinating in recent years. However, a sudden opening due to a loss of trust is being seen as a market gap that these businesses capitalised initially. These businesses are becoming disenchanted with capitalism and its increasing inequalities based structure (Edelman 2020). According to the 2020 Edelman Trust Barometer, amid a robust global economy and near-full jobs, none of the four social institutions studied—government, industry, non-governmental organisations, and the media—are trusted. The 2021 Edelman Confidence Barometer (Edelman 2021) shows an epidemic of disinformation and pervasive mistrust of societal structures and leaders around the globe, after a year of unparalleled catastrophe and turmoil – the Covid-19 pandemic and economic recession, the global uproar over structural injustice and political uncertainty. The failing ecosystem of trust throughout the population can be found in people’s fears of their role in the future. Trust all over the world is spurred by economic growth, and the current coronavirus pandemic is adding to this failing trust ecosystem (AMADEUS 2019). Edelman reports (Ibrahim 2016): “Despite a four-point rise in confidence in industry and many high-profile measures taken by businesses and CEOs to support those in need, the private sector’s performance since the recession has been markedly disappointing.” So, people now seem to regard governments, especially local governments in some countries, as the most trustworthy bodies (Matyszczyk 2020). However, half of people think business is doing a bad, mediocre, or full job of putting workers above profits; only 43 percent believe businesses are adequately shielding their workers from Covid-19, and 46 percent believe industry is not assisting smaller suppliers and company consumers in staying alive(Edelman 2021). At this point, it’s just Elon Musk’s Forays into the limelight that have not always been fruitful. It is sad that, at a time when people are searching for certainty, Elon Musk, the center of attention, is unable to offer anything more than akin to swagger. For the purpose of our discussion, we take a deeper look at Elon’s Leadership, and how his style of leadership helps him face the challenge of Trust.</p> <h2 id="leadership-style-to-win-trust---transformational-and-charismatic">Leadership style to win Trust - Transformational and Charismatic</h2> <p>As a fellow INTJ, Elon Musk leads successfully with a dynamic leadership style that incorporates the highlights of authoritative strategies, despite being a genuine charismatic servant leader. Musk uses democracy to elicit input and engagement, but he is coercive when it comes to ensuring obedience, dealing with crises, cultivating and compelling affiliations, and forming relational bonds inside each organisation (Padgett. N 2015). Elon’s philosophy aligns well with the earlier discussed personal philosophy of leadership, in terms of decision feedback-evaluation and having a larger-than-life vision. When asked what he considers to be the most powerful leadership characteristic, Musk responds (Ramani 2016:</p> <blockquote> <p>“I believe it is important to create a feedback loop in which you are always thinking about what you’ve done and how you could do it differently. I believe that is the single most important bit of advice: Constantly question yourself and consider how you could do it differently”.</p> </blockquote> <p>As part of their Psychology curriculum, a group of Penn State students collaborated on a Leadership blog to offer a practical study of Elon Musk’s leadership style. According to experts, Musk’s leadership habits correspond with Bennis and Nanus’transformational leadership techniques (McGrath and Bate 2021). Anything about “Musk” is infused with vision. Elon Musk has been seen in observational trials involving other business innovators to manage objections without losing his stride. Musk is at the forefront of politicians who transcend personal or environmental obstacles, demonstrating the complexity of the mission and the level of transformation required to accomplish their goals as well as the bravery to confront risks and difficulties in the achievement of their objectives(Thiel 2015). Transformational leadership, according to (Bass 1985), motivates followers to do better than anticipated by (a) raising followers’ levels of consciousness regarding the meaning and significance of defined and idealised goals, (b) ringing followers to sacrifice their own self interest for the benefit of the team or organisation, and (c) pushing followers to meet higher-level goals. Transformational leaders often have solid internal beliefs and ideals, and they are successful at inspiring followers to respond in ways that benefit the common good rather than their own self-interests (Kuhnert 1994). One of the factors that transformational leadership incorporates is ‘Idealised Influence’ or often referred to as charisma or idealised power. The idealised influence factor is calculated using two components: an attributional component that refers to followers’ attributions of leaders based on impressions of their leaders, and a behavioral component that refers to followers’ evaluations of leaders behaviour (Northouse 2019). It is sometimes defined in terms that make Charismatic Leadership sound equivalent to, if not identical to, transformational leadership (Khatri et al. 2001). In conclusion, charismatic leadership is effective since it connects followers and their self-concepts to the corporate identity.</p> <blockquote> <p>image will be added</p> </blockquote> <p>Until now, we have looked at Elon Musk’s transformational and charismatic leadership style, now let us see if his style is winning the challenge of trust. Elon Musk motivates his followers and, while he has high hopes for them, he still has high expectations for himself. Elon emphasises for those in positions of authority must be committed to doing the work required for the company’s success until they can persuade others to contribute (Ruth 2017). Employers work tirelessly to make the boss satisfied. Shawn Achor, a world-renowned psychologist, claims in his book “The Happiness Advantage” that happiness and positivity are primary factors of success in terms of performance and productivity (Achor 2011).</p> <blockquote> <p>image will be added</p> </blockquote> <p>Marcial Losada, a psychologist and industry strategist, discovered that the ratio of positive-to-negative relationships is 2.9013 following detailed statistical modelling required for the best performance of a management team (Yauney 2018). Furthermore, Losada found that, while teams just over the “Losada Line” (Tewari 2021) are not hampered by negativity, teams that achieve a positive-to-negative statement ratio of six-to-one achieve optimum levels of success. Managers have a huge ability to shape workplace culture when they normally work with a vast number of workers.</p> <p>As learnt earlier, Elon has his managers extremely committed to the common goal and in turn building commitment among the employees by keeping them happy. In this way, Musk is turning employees and followers into his fans (Stephen 2018). While Elon Musk is a one-of-a-kind CEO, many of the leadership traits that have contributed to his success can be cultivated in managers at all levels of an organisation. Companies with a strategic advantage should invest in their human resources by fostering a work environment conducive to the development of quality managers (James MacGregor Burns 2021). A workplace culture focused on lifelong learning, leading by example, strong project goals, and positivity is the greenhouse in which workers can mature into successful managers (Yauney 2018). Companies who pay the price for cultivating a good office culture will continually stand out and see significant internal development as workers move up to become successful bosses and branch out the company.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">“MUSK SEEMS TO HIS FANS, LIKE THE ONE GUY YOU CAN TRUST” -THE VERGE</code></p> <h1 id="leadership-analysis--princess-diana">Leadership analysis – Princess Diana</h1> <h2 id="about-the-leader-1">About the leader</h2> <p>Lady Diana Spencer rose to prominence as a stunning young British aristocrat who married Prince Charles, the heir presumptive to the British throne. Her wedding to Prince Charles was broadcast, and millions of viewers around the world tuned in. She was a reserved and lovely British aristocrat (Mthembu n.d.). The princess appeared in an era when the royal family of Great Britain ruled their realm from the luxuries of their throne, and she would transform the face of the royal family. Princess Diana was one of the world’s most prominent women, having been voted one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century (SAMUEL 2016). She was known as the “people’s princess” until her tragic death in a car crash (Laliberte 2021) in 1997. This raised some questions like “What makes Princess Diana such an important person?”, “Why were 2.5 billion people interested in her funeral?”,and “How did she alter the way her country treated social problems that had been seen as unfavorable for centuries?”</p> <h2 id="leadership-style--transformational-and-servant">Leadership style – Transformational and Servant</h2> <p>Princess Diana exemplifies the servant leader. A great leader is first and foremost seen as a subordinate, and this plain truth is the secret to her greatness. What she is on the inside. In her efforts to help others (Sendjaya and Sarros 2002), Princess Diana raised awareness of AIDS research and malnutrition awareness in impoverished nations, demonstrated concern for people suffering from leprosy when it was still considered an untouchable illness, and campaigned against the use of land mines. She displayed servant leadership characteristics such as listening, patience, healing, understanding, persuasion, conceptualisation, and foresight (Eva et al. 2019). One of Lady Diana’s most inspiring moments as a politician was raising awareness about the social stigma associated with those living with the HIV/AIDS virus. In the 1980s, many people suspected that HIV/Aids could be transmitted simply by contacting an infected human (Kizer 2010). Lady Diana, in front of the world’s newspapers, kissed the hand of a man suffering from this disease to inspire sympathy and empathy. Lady Diana Spencer demonstrated several leadership skills in the preceding example. Her personality characteristics of modesty, honesty, self-confidence, and trustworthiness altered how many people saw someone suffering from Aids (Hai and Van 2021). She raised global recognition for unglamorous issues and set an example for future royal generations, including each of her sons. Her career zeal, courage, sound work integrity, and motivation paved the way for others to follow in her footsteps. Many of his celebrity friends founded charities in her honor to support causes dear to her heart (Hesse 1956). The servant leadership model is made up of three parts: antecedent circumstances, servant leader attitudes, and outcomes. The model’s core emphasis is on the seven leader practices that promote servant leadership: conceptualising, mental healing, placing followers first, assisting followers in growing and succeeding, acting ethically, inspiring, and providing meaning for the world (Northouse 2019).</p> <ul> <li>Servant first, then a Queen She demonstrated servant leadership characteristics such as listening, empathy, healing, understanding, persuasion, conceptualisation, foresight, stewardship, dedication to people’s development, and communication building. She was invited to partner with several charities as a member of the British Royal family, but unlike former royals, she preferred charities that she was drawn to (Eva et al. 2019). She was more than just patronage and media appearances; she was genuinely committed to her charities and wished to make a difference in the lives of those who were marginalised by society. Greenleaf’s pioneering work on the servant as chief is represented by the ten qualities of servant leadership. They have a fresh perspective on the nuances of servant leadership (Greenleaf 1970). Elton John delivered an HIV lecture dubbed “The Diana, Princess of Wales Lecture on HIV” in 2018, to an audience that included not only health staff but also politicians and celebrities(CHOW 2021). In his address, Elton John emphasised Diana, Princess of Wales’s significantcontribution to such a vital cause, as well as how her battle against the stigmas associated with this disease has had a long-lasting effect on this culture.</li> </ul> <h2 id="leadership-analysis">Leadership Analysis</h2> <p>Transformational (charisma aspect) and servant leadership have a deep biblical relationship. Princess Diana was able to “empower her fans by improving their perceptions of self-efficacy and faith in their abilities to conquer challenges, using emotional persuasion and verbal affirmation, and serving as a role model (Sendjaya and Sarros 2002).” Princess Diana’s charismatic attribute is described as her “individual personality by virtue of which she is distinguished from ordinary men and regarded as endowed with magical, superhuman, or at the very least clearly exceptional attributes.”It is important to distinguish between a servant leader and a transformational leader when describing Princess Diana as a servant leader. In two ways, servant leadership outperforms transformational leadership (Bass 1985). 1) “its appreciation of the leader’s social responsibility to represent all individuals who are oppressed by a scheme” 2) “its commitment to the wishes and desires of followers rather than their own or their company. According to theorists Choi and Mai-Dalton (Choi and Mai-Dalton 1999), “it may merely be nothing more than a ploy to impress followers and exploit their reactions to reciprocate,” but what will Princess Diana personally benefit by helping others? Princess Diana was a servant first, then a queen. Her job as a servant forced her to take the reins. “The servant chief is first and foremost a servant” (Greenleaf 1970). It all starts with the innate need to serve, to serve first. Then, through deliberate decision, one aspires to lead. As Princess Diana once said, “I’d like to be a queen in people’s hearts”, so now,</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">THE PEOPLE’S QUEEN'S LEGACY IS UP TO HER FANS TO CARRY FORWARD.</code></p> <h1 id="references">References</h1> <p>Achor, S.

We have been hearing this over the past couple of decades. Is it just an irrational fideism or maybe the prophecies have an error of -10+ , -100+ and so on. Schmidhuber try to extend the naive analysis of past computer science breakthroughs in the intro-duction, which predicts that computer history will converge in an Omega point or historic singularity X around 2040. Could it be that such lists just reflect the human way of allocating memory space to past events Maybe there is a general rule for both the individual memory of single humans and the collective memory of entire societies and their history books. He basically tries to say if history repeats itself, which is the first research which I try to answer through my project.</p> <p>1) <a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/history.html">Will History Converge?</a> Is it a co-incidence or if there is a pattern repeating itself? This research question will be answered based on the research question 2.</p> <p>One of the breakthroughs that can cause this next big revolution is the creation of a super Intelligence, or more specifically, Artificial General Intelligence. According to the above convergence hypothesis, we are due to see this AGI in the next few decades. This idea gives rise to my second research question, that is,</p> <p>2) What is the possibility of such an AGI to come into existence, if Yes, what is probability of an intelligence explosion?</p> <p>[ There are two possible types of intelligence speedup: one due to faster operation of an intelligent system (clock speed increase or the hardware) and one due to an improvement in the type of mechanisms that implement the thought processes (‘‘depth of thought’’ increase or the software). Obviously, both could occur at once (and there may be significant synergies), but the latter is ostensibly more difficult to achieve, and may be subject to fundamental limits that we do not understand. Speeding up the hardware, on the other hand, is something that has been going on for a long time and is more mundane and reliable. Notice that both routes lead to greater ‘‘intelligence,’’ because even a human level of thinking and creativity would be more effective if it were happening a thousand times faster than it does now. It seems possible that the general class of AGI systems can be architected to take better advantage of improved hardware than would be the case with intelligent systems very narrowly imitative of the human brain. But even if this is not the case, brute hardware speedup can still yield dramatic intelligent improvement.] This section of text from <a href="https://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2011-January/063255.html">Richard Loosemore</a>, suggests that the explosion can be measured and we can clearly discard limiting factors such as investment ability, software complexity and hardware advancement.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis :</strong> Once an AI system with roughly human-level general intelligence is created, an ‘‘intelligence explosion’’ involving the relatively rapid creation of increasingly more generally intelligent AI systems will very likely ensue, resulting in the rapid emergence of dramatically superhuman intelligences.</p> <p><strong>Null Hypothesis :</strong> No creation of that SEED AGI to begin with.</p> <h1 id="papers-in-the-field-and-data-sources">Papers in the field and Data Sources</h1> <ol> <li> <p><a href="https://uol.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9783642325601&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=353UOL_INST:353UOL_VU1&amp;lang=en&amp;search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&amp;adaptor=Primo%20Central&amp;tab=TAB1&amp;query=any,contains,singularity%20hypothesis&amp;sortby=rank">The Main Book</a> – UL Glucksman Library</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32560-1_4">Research Question 1</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2011-January/063255.html">Research Question 2</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://otexts.com/fpp2/forecasting-regression.html">Forecasting model data</a> and <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Estimations_of_Human_Brain_Emulation_Required_Performance.svg">Human level AGI forecast</a></p> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Relevant research:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Baum, S.

John McGuire,the founder of ‘<a href="https://www.gamegolf.com/about">GameGolf</a>’, when his idea was copied and mass produced in china, followed a right move any organization should do. Instead of looking at the situation in a negative way, he took advantage of the data he had and expanded it to other territories by increasing his field of vision, as well as the vison and objective of GameGolf.Most companies recognize that they have opportunities to use data and analytics to raise productivity, improve decision making, and gain competitive advantage. “Analytics will define the difference between the losers and winners going forward,” says Tim McGuire, a McKinsey director. But, mapping out an analytics plan is complicated. You must set a strategy; draw a detailed road map for investing in assets such as technology, tools, and data sets; and tackle the intrinsic challenges of securing commitment, reinventing processes.Broadly speaking any organization must consider the following keys to build an effective data driven strategy.</p> <h3 id="choose-the-right-data">Choose the right data</h3> <p>Over the last five years, the universe of data and modelling has shifted vastly. The amount of knowledge is increasing, whilst opportunities are accelerating to extend perspectives by integrating data. Bigger and improved data provide enterprises with both more panoramic and more granular views of their corporate climate. The opportunity to see what was previously unknown enhances behaviours, client encounters, and policy. That means boosting the game in two ways, they are -Sourcing the data creatively:Managers will need to develop the potential of external and current data sources in an innovative way. In the form of conversations, images and videos, social media produces terabytes of non-traditional, unstructured data. In addition, data streams from sensors, tracked systems, and external sources ranging from local populations to weather predictions are added to that. One way to promote wider thought about future knowledge is to suggest, “What choices could we make if we had all the data we need?”Getting the necessary IT supportExisting IT architectures may prevent the integration of siloed information, and managing unstructured data often remains beyond traditional IT capabilities.It also takes years to fully fix these problems. Market owners though will meet the demands of big data in the near term by partnering with CIOs to prioritize criteria. This ensures that the most relevant data for analytics use is easily found and connected and then a cleaning operation is mounted to synchronize and reconcile overlapping data and work around lost information.</p> <h3 id="build-models-that-predict-and-optimize-business-outcomes">Build models that predict and optimize business outcomes.</h3> <p>Data are essential, but improvements in efficiency and competitive advantage benefit from computational models that allow managers to anticipate and maximize results. More specifically, not with the data, but with the discovery of a market opportunity and deciding how the model will boost efficiency, the most productive approach to developing a model generally begins. In functional data relationships that are more widely understood by administrators, we have observed that such hypothesis-led modelling produces quicker findings and root models.</p> <h3 id="transform-your-companys-capabilities">Transform your company’s capabilities.</h3> <p>The concerned senior executives express to us is that their managers do not understand or trust big data–based models and, consequently, don’t use them. Bottom line: using big data requires thoughtful organizational change, and three areas of action can get you there, they are</p> <ul> <li> <p>Developing business-relevant analytics that can be used Many initial Big Data and Analytics applications fail because they are not in line with the regular practices and decision-making requirements of an organization. Model planners need to consider the sorts of strategic decisions that executives make to match their actions with wider business priorities. Conversations with frontline management can ensure that analytics and instruments support current decision-making procedures such that organizations can better address a variety of trade-offs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Embed analytics in simple tools for the front lines Managers require straightforward ways to make regular use of the latest models and algorithms. By necessity, to sharpen marketing, risk management and operations, terabytes of data and sophisticated modelling are needed. The key is to distinguish the specialists in analytics and app engineers from the managers who use the observations that are powered by results. The goal: to provide intuitive tools and interfaces to frontline managers that support them with their work.</p> </li> <li> <p>Developing capabilities to exploit big data Even with simple and usable models, most organizations will need to upgrade their analytical skills and literacy. To make analytics part of the fabric of daily operations, managers must view it as central to solving problems and identifying opportunities.Based on the targets and expected timeline of an organization, attempts can differ. Usually, adjusting cultures and mind-sets requires a multifaceted approach that entails preparation, leadership role modelling, and rewards and indicators to strengthen actions. For example, adult learners also benefit from a “field and forum” approach in which they engage in real-world, analytical-based job choices that help them to learn by doing so.(Barton and Court 2013)</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>The use of Analytics is increasing across industries. It is fuelled by trending concepts like big data and data science, innovative technologies such as distributed computing and inmemory databases, as well as the rapid increase of data available for processing. A recent survey showed a constant increase of organizations perceiving the role of Analytics as critical, a closing maturity and capability gap between digital natives and traditional companies in applying Analytics and its strategic role, as embodied in appointments of Clevel executives for Analytics. ‘Competitive advantage’ is frequently discussed in the strategic management literature. The resource-based view argues for competitive advantage based on the resources of firms, including assets, capabilities, processes, attributes, and knowledge—if these are rare, imperfectly imitable, and non-substitutable.

Starting with huge data right away, we will swim in it and we will not be able to swim out of that ocean.</li> <li>As you get into digital marketing, social medial and heavy analytics.

The more customers a firm has, the more data it can gather and mine; the resulting insights allow it to offer a better product that attracts even more customers, from which it can collect still more data.</p> <p><strong>The REALITY:</strong>Even when customer data does confer a competitive advantage, it gives rise to network effects only infrequently. And that advantage may not last.</p> <p><strong>The SOLUTION:</strong> To understand the edge that data-enabled learning can provide, companies should answer seven questions, which examine the value of the data; whether its marginal value drops quickly; how fast it becomes obsolete; whether it’s proprietary; whether the improvements from it can be easily imitated; whether they enhance the product for current users, other users, or both; and how fast insights can be incorporated into products.

Here are the four challenges most frequently faced by global enterprises and how you can overcome each one.

Carefully analyse the conditions that influence your company today and find areas where business results can be enhanced by the implementation of intelligent analytics tools. Think if emerging innovations are going to help the business become more profitable, save money, or contribute to better goods and services being created. Many of the information gathered by companies is simply noise before the proper technology and methods are applied to explain what it means.</p> <h3 id="relying-too-heavily-on-either-top-down-or-bottom-up-initiatives">Relying Too Heavily on Either Top-Down or Bottom-Up Initiatives.</h3> <p>Test the existing analytical capabilities of the new workforce, frankly. Doing so will offer two major insights. First, it can help you recognize analytics-savvy influencerswithin your organization-people who may not have the most senior roles, but who may persuade colleagues to embrace new ways of operating because of their experience and collaborative connections. Second, the internal review would also reveal holes in talent that need to be filled. opt for new employees or external collaborators who show a strong track record of successful use of data.</p> <h3 id="failing-to-build-on-success">Failing to Build on Success.</h3> <p>Business projects should be defined by the corporate analytics team where data-driven decision-making also provides well recorded benefits.
