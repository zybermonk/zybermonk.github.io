I live in Europe, originally from India❤️. Currently, I build AI models for businesses and conduct comprehensive research on AI and general economics. I studied engineering at [PES University](https://pes.edu/) and business at the [University of Limerick](https://www.ul.ie/).

Previously, I have worked as a gym instructor and  I have held artificial intelligence and data related roles at [Altada](https://www.altada.com/) and [StatsPerform](https://www.statsperform.com/) 

My goal is to find satisfying solutions to life's metaphysical concerns, but I recognize that this is an impossible endeavor. Meanwhile, my goal is to contribute to humanity's comprehension of the aforementioned questions, to observe the boundary conditions of the human experience, and to live a life to the maximum entropy.
