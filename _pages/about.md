I live in Europe, originally from India. Currently, I am in the pursuit of my Ph.D in Deep Learning. I will be working on visual perception, simulation, prediction and planning for autnomous machines. 

I studied Engineering at [PES University](https://pes.edu/) and Business at the University of Limerick's, [Kemmy Business School](https://www.ul.ie/business). 

Previously, I have worked as a gym instructor and  I have held artificial intelligence and data related roles at [Altada](https://www.altada.com/) and [StatsPerform](https://www.statsperform.com/) 

My goal is to find satisfying solutions to life's metaphysical concerns, but I recognize that this is a difficult endeavor. Meanwhile, my goal is to contribute to humanity's comprehension of the aforementioned questions, to observe the boundary conditions of the human experience, and to live a life to the maximum entropy.
